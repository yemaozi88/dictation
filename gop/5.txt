Mr. and Mrs. Anderson are from Norway. They live near the North Sea.
 One day last summer, Mrs. Anderson was walking on the beach. At that time, she lost one of her gold earrings. It dropped down into the sand and was gone.
 Two weeks later, her husband went fishing in the same place. He caught a large fish and took it home. When he cut open the fish, he found his wife's lost earring inside. "I couldn't believe my eyes!" he said. Mrs. Anderson was just as surprised. "Think of all the many fish swimming around there. The same one that ate my earring tried to eat my husband's fish hook. It's hard to imagine!" Mr. Anderson didn't know he had been fishing in the same place where his wife lost her jewellery. Of course, they were both excited and very glad with the story's happy ending.
